# the JSON Folder

I have a "globe API" project going on and needed a JSON list of capital latitudes and longitudes.
I think I will extend the list to further lists with TimeZones, which Hemisphere, Population, ... 

## countryCapitals.json
List order by continents and alphabet </br>

includes: </br>
          - country name as "Name" </br>
          - countries capital as "Capital" </br>
          - latitude value as "Lat" </br>
          - longitude value as "Lng" </br>
